// Cluster consists of a group of nodes to manage distributed tables defined in models/table.go.
// The Cluster object itself can also be viewed as the only coordinator of a cluster, which means client requests
// should go through it instead of the nodes.
// Of course, it is possible to make any of the nodes a coordinator and to make the cluster decentralized. You are
// welcomed to make such changes and may earn some extra points.

// and send requests to it. WARNING: the given name should not be like "Node0", "Node1", ..., as they will conflict
// with some predefined names.
// The created nodes are identified by simple numbers starting from 0, e.g., if we have 3 nodes, the identifiers of the
// three nodes will be "Node0", "Node1", and "Node2".
// Each node is bound to a server in the network which follows the same naming rule, for the example above, the three
// nodes will be bound to  servers "Node0", "Node1", and "Node2" respectively.
// In practice, we may mix the usages of terms "Node" and "Server", both of them refer to a specific machine, while in
// the lab, a "Node" is responsible for processing distributed affairs but a "Server" simply receives messages from the
