// Cluster consists of a group of nodes to manage distributed tables defined in models/table.go.

// should go through it instead of the nodes.

// welcomed to make such changes and may earn some extra points.

// with some predefined names.
// The created nodes are identified by simple numbers starting from 0, e.g., if we have 3 nodes, the identifiers of the
// three nodes will be "Node0", "Node1", and "Node2".
// Each node is bound to a server in the network which follows the same naming rule, for the example above, the three
// nodes will be bound to  servers "Node0", "Node1", and "Node2" respectively.
